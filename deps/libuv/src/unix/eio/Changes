Revision history for libeio

TODO: maybe add mincore support? available on at least darwin, solaris, linux, freebsd
TODO: openbsd requires stdint.h for intptr_t - why posix?

TODO: make mtouch/readdir maybe others cancellable in-request
TODO: fadvise request
1.0
	- fix a deadlock where a wakeup signal could be missed when
          a timeout occured at the same time.
	- use nonstandard but maybe-working-on-bsd fork technique.
        - use fewer time() syscalls when waiting for new requests.
        - fix a path-memory-leak in readdir when using the wrappers
          (reported by Thomas L. Shinnick).
	- support a max_idle value of 0.
	- support setting of idle timeout value (eio_set_idle_timeout).
        - readdir: correctly handle malloc failures.
        - readdir: new flags argument, can return inode
          and possibly filetype, can sort in various ways.
        - readdir: stop immediately when cancelled, do
          not continue reading the directory.
        - fix return value of eio_sendfile_sync.
        - include sys/mman.h for msync.
	- added EIO_STACKSIZE.
	- added msync, mtouch support (untested).
        - added sync_file_range (untested).
        - fixed custom support.
        - use a more robust feed-add detection method.
	- "outbundled" from IO::AIO.
        - eio_set_max_polltime did not properly convert time to ticks.
        - tentatively support darwin in sendfile.
        - fix freebsd/darwin sendfile.
        - also use sendfile emulation for ENOTSUP and EOPNOTSUPP
          error codes.
        - add OS-independent EIO_MT_* and EIO_MS_* flag enums.
        - add eio_statvfs/eio_fstatvfs.
        - add eio_mlock/eio_mlockall and OS-independent MCL_* flag enums.
        - no longer set errno to 0 before making syscalls, this only lures
          people into the trap of believing errno shows success or failure.
        - "fix" demo.c so that it works as non-root.
        - suppoert utimes seperately from futimes, as some systems have
          utimes but not futimes.
        - use _POSIX_MEMLOCK_RANGE for mlock.
        - do not (errornously) overwrite CFLAGS in configure.ac.
        - mknod used int3 for dev_t (ยง2 bit), not offs (64 bit).
        - fix memory corruption in eio_readdirx for the flags
          combination EIO_READDIR_STAT_ORDER | EIO_READDIR_DIRS_FIRST.
        - port to openbsd (another blatantly broken non-UNIX/POSIX platform).
        - fix eio_custom prototype.
        - work around a Linux (and likely FreeBSD and other kernels) bug
          where sendfile would not transfer all the requested bytes on
          large transfers, using a heuristic.
        - use libecb, and apply lots of minor space optimisations.
        - disable sendfile on darwin, broken as everything else.
        - add realpath request and implementation.
	- cancelled requests will still invoke their request callbacks.
        - add fallocate.
        - do not acquire any locks when forking.
        - incorporated some mingw32 changes by traviscline.
        - added syncfs support, using direct syscall.
        - set thread name on linux (ps -L/Hcx, top, gdb).
        - remove useless use of volatile variables.
